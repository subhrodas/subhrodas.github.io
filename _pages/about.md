Subhro Das is a Principal Applied Scientist in the [Applied Science](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/odsp-applied-science) team at Microsoft. His research interests are broadly in the areas of Representation Learning, Generative AI, Foundation Models, Trustworthy Machine Learning, Large Language Models, Reinforcement Learning and ML Optimization methods. His work focuses on long-context understanding, uncertainty quantification and human-centric system design with large language and multimodal models.

Previously, he was a Staff Research Scientist / Research Manager at the [MIT-IBM AI Lab](https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu/) in [IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/) and a Research Affiliate at MIT. His research papers are published in top machine learning and signal processing venues, including ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, AAAI, AISTATS, EACL, TMLR, IEEE TSP and ICASSP. He was an IBM Master Inventor and have filed 25+ patents in machine learning.

He has deep expertise on post-training techniques and alignment methods for LLMs, especially in fine-tuning, instruction tuning, reinforcement learning and synthetic data generation. He developed a pipeline for large-scale long-context instruction following data generation, with variety of reasoning tasks, for training Granite (IBM's LLM) models. Contributed to the post-training of [Granite 3.1](https://www.ibm.com/new/announcements/ibm-granite-3-1-powerful-performance-long-context-and-more), and multimodal model [Granite Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09927). <br>
